**Basic Questions**
1. Write a Python program to check if a given number is positive, negative, or zero.
2. Write a program that asks the user for their age and prints whether they are eligible to vote (age ≥ 18).
3. Write a program to check if a given number is even or odd.
4. Create a program that takes a temperature in Celsius and prints whether it's cold (<20°C), moderate (20-30°C), or hot (>30°C).
**Intermediate Questions**
5. Write a program to find the largest of two numbers entered by the user.
6. Create a Python program that calculates a discount:
7. If the total bill amount is more than $100, apply a 10% discount.
Otherwise, no discount is applied.
8. Write a program that checks if a year is a leap year. (Hint: A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not by 100, unless it is divisible by 400.)
9. Create a program that asks the user for three numbers and prints the smallest number.
**Advanced Questions**
10. Write a program that takes an exam score as input and assigns grades as follows:
90-100: A
80-89: B
70-79: C
60-69: D
Below 60: F
11. Write a program to calculate the roots of a quadratic equation using the formula. Check if the discriminant is:
Positive (real roots),
Zero (one real root), or
Negative (complex roots).
12. Write a program to simulate a login system:
Ask for a username and password.
If the username is admin and the password is 1234, print "Login successful."
Otherwise, print "Invalid credentials."
13. Create a program to check if a number is divisible by both 3 and 5.
Fun & Real-Life Scenarios
14. Write a program that asks the user for their height (in cm) and weight (in kg) and calculates their BMI. Display a message based on the BMI value:
Underweight: BMI < 18.5
Normal: 18.5 ≤ BMI < 25
Overweight: 25 ≤ BMI < 30
Obese: BMI ≥ 30
15. Write a program that simulates a traffic light:
Ask the user to input the light color (red, yellow, green).
Print a message based on the input:
Red: "Stop"
Yellow: "Ready to move"
Green: "Go"
16. Create a program that simulates a simple calculator:
Take two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) as input.
Perform the operation and print the result.
Handle division by zero with an appropriate message.
**Challenge Questions**
17. Write a program that determines if a string entered by the user is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward).
18. Write a program that asks the user for a number and prints whether it is a "Perfect Number." (Hint: A perfect number is a number whose sum of divisors equals the number itself, e.g., 6: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.)
Implement a program that checks if a number is part of the Fibonacci sequence.
19. Write a program to determine if a triangle is valid given its three sides. (Hint: Check if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side.)
